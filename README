EMP Command
-----------

Multitouch clone of the 80's Atari Missile Command
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command )

Enemies must be defeated with fierce touches on your multitouch surface,
but be aware of timings and ammo!
Bonus powerups are given for multiple kills with single missiles:

 * AMMO powerup (3 enemies in one shot): turret ammo will be refilled
 * NUKE powerup (4 enemies or more): the designated turret will
    launch a super powerful missile that will wipe out most of the
    enemies

Powerups can be deployed with a drag&drop to one of the living turrets.
Keep cities from being destroyed if you want to raise up your score and consider
that once a turret has been hit for three times, it's gone, along with its ammo.

Turrets and cities locations are always shuffled. Missile launches are automated:
the closest turret (which has ammo) to your target request launches.
